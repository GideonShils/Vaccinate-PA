# Additional Resources

_Updated as of January 22_

<br />

For the latest official updates from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, visit: [https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Vaccine.aspx](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Vaccine.aspx)
Note, Philadelphia is a separate jurisdiction for the covid vaccine rollout. Philadelphia County has its own timetable, rules and requirements; Philadelphia information can be found [here](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/vaccines/about-covid-19-vaccine/).

## Where can I get the vaccine?

The list of locations with active vaccine inventory is changing frequently. Our volunteer team is calling these locations and publishing onto this website which locations have inventory and how Pennsylvanians can make an appointment. Visit the [Vaccine Availability page of this website](https://vaccinatepa.org/) for that information. (This list of facilities comes from the Pennsylvania Dept of Healthâ€™s [official vaccine page](https://www.pa.gov/guides/get-vaccinated/#Step2FindaVaccineProvider).)
As of January 22nd, it remains difficult even for eligible Pennsylvanians to obtain a vaccine due to vaccine supply shortages. We will continue to update this website as more and more locations receive vaccine supply and as they provide means for Pennsylvanians to book an appointment.

## How can I sign up for vaccines in my county?

People working or living in specific counties may be able to complete a pre-registration form in order to be contacted by the county when a vaccine is available for their group. If you do not see your county listed below, please refer to your county's website in order to determine whether your county has launched a pre-registration form.
